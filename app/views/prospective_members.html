      <div class="itc-h5">What is Club Cross Country/Track and Field?</div>
      <div>Your (competitive) running career does not need to end in high school. At University of Illinois, the club offers a unique experience to the college student athlete. By participating in club, you will be able to continue competing while also receiving a world class education that is not available at most schools with similar levels of competition. Club-level strives to train and compete at the level of NCAA DIII programs.</div>
      <div>The truly magical aspect of club is that we show up every day completely voluntarily. We make no cuts, have no fixed roster spots, and there is no competition for scholarships. Athletes come every day simply because they love to run and have a desire to compete to the best of their ability.</div>
      <div>IXC/ITC is a member of the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association (NIRCA). Think of NIRCA as the NCAA of club running. Nation-wide, there are over 120 NIRCA member clubs, with many teams to race against in the cross country and track and field seasons. Both our men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams have been fixtures at the top of NIRCA since its inception in 2005.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <div class="itc-h5">What opportunities does Club Cross Country offer? </div>
      <div>The Illinois Cross Country Club participates in 5-6 races each fall. These races are run at the club, NCAA DIII and even NCAA DI levels, so there people to run with for runners of all abilities. Our season culminates at the NIRCA National Championship Meet. There are no time or place qualifiers for this meet, so again, all abilities can participate. This offers a unique opportunity to experience post-season cross country against teams nation-wide.&nbsp;</div>
      <div>The Illinois Track Club begins racing as early as December, with meets held nearly every weekend throughout the semester. Track, unlike cross country, often has limited entries at each meet, but the multitude of meets we attend means that everyone gets a chance to compete a few times over the course of the semester. Just like cross country, a Club National Championship Meet offers an opportunity to compete against clubs from all over the country.</div>
      <div>Aside from the competition, the club also provides a great support network and helps to forge some of the best friendships you will have in college. It is a friendly environment from day one, and we have many social and volunteering activities outside of running to build these relationships.</div>
      <div>Furthermore, we are a completely student run organization at University of Illinois. The leaders of our club are elected by the members of the team at the end of each season. As a member of the club, you have the opportunity to demonstrate passion and make important decisions on the club by becoming a leader as early as your sophomore year. If you are looking to foster your own leadership ability while continuing to do what you love, then ITC/IXC is perfect for you.</div>

    <div class="faq-question">
      <div class="itc-h5">How/when do we train?</div>
      <div>For cross country, training plans are written by the coach and gender minority captain. They take into account varying ability levels and busy schedules. In track and cross country, distance meets every weekday at 4:15 PM and on Sunday mornings for long runs at the west side of the Armory (by the flagpole). Sprinters and throwers usually meet weekdays at 6 PM at the Armory. During the winter, everyone meets at 10 PM at the Armory on Tuesdays.</div>

      <div class="itc-h5">What is the cost?</div>
      <div>There is a fee to be a member of the club, typically $20. Each meet usually costs $10-$15. We pride ourselves on having financial transperancy and keeping costs to a minimum.
